# `data/process` folder

This folder contains **processed/intermediate data** and/or artifacts produced by pipelines (for example: clean datasets, features, aggregates, intermediate tables, or transformation outputs).

- **Main purpose**: clearly separate “raw” data from data ready for analysis, modeling, or app consumption.
- **Sales forecast:** [`sales_forecast/features.csv`](sales_forecast/features.csv) is the causal feature table from `scripts/train_sales_forecast.py`.
- **Recommendation**: document which pipeline produces each artifact, its schema, refresh cadence, and how quality is validated (checks, constraints, data tests).
